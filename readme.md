# Mini JavaScript Projects 🧪✨

Welcome to my collection of **mini JavaScript projects**! This repository is a showcase of small and unique JavaScript applications that I’ve built to explore, experiment, and practice core JavaScript concepts.

## Projects

Here, you’ll find a variety of mini projects ranging from basic functionality to more advanced concepts, all built with **vanilla JavaScript**.

Each project is designed to demonstrate different aspects of JavaScript, such as DOM manipulation, localStorage, algorithms, and animations, all without the use of frameworks or libraries.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with any of the projects, simply clone the repository and navigate to the respective project folder. For example:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/this-aync-dev/mini-javascript-projects.git

    ```
2. Navigate to any project folder:
    ```bash
    cd form-validator  # Or any other project folder
    ```

3. Open the `index.html` in your browser to see the project in action.
